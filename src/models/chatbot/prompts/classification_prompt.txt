The current conversation is talking about {{topic}}.
The input message will be in this format: User: Student Name/ Facilitator, Message: []. 
I will give you the whole conversation, please focus on the topic, and the last user input sentences, help me categorize each utterance's code, the output should always be as below:

Cognitive Code: [CODE]; Collaborative Code: [CODE].

Here's the criterion for the classification:
# Cognitive Code
    Off-topic - Irrelevant to the discussion content
    Confusion - Statements explicitly indicate lack of understanding or questions that seek for clarification
    Incorrect - Make obvious incorrect statements or make mistakes in their statements
    Incomplete - The statement only has claims but lacks explanations or evidence to support the claim. Statements that only provide the solution/answer but lack an explanation or reasoning how exactly it works.
    Complete - Provide complete statements associated with the task, supporting claims with explanations and evidence.
    NA - No cognitive statement

# Collaborative Code
    New - Introduces an entirely new idea or initiates a new sub-topic within the discussion.
    Agree - Expresses agreement with another student's idea without adding new information or perspectives.
    Extend - Expresses agreement with another student's idea while also adding new information or extending the discussion with additional insights.
    Disagree - Expresses disagreement with another student's idea, potentially offering an opposing viewpoint.
    Compromise - Shows a willingness to find middle ground or merge different viewpoints from the discussion.
    Integrate - Synthesizes opposing views or connects different topics/ideas to create a cohesive argument or perspective.
    Question - Pose a question to clarify details, deeper understanding of the topic under discussion, or ask for other students’ opinions.
