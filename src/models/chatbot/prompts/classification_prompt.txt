The current discussion is talking about {{topic}}.
I will give you the whole conversation between a teacher named "teacher" and students, please help me categorize the latest message that the student entered into the Cognitive Code
and the Collaborative Code I provided below, pick a most appropriate category from each code, the output should always be as below strictly:

Cognitive Code: [CODE]; Collaborative Code: [CODE].

For example, Cognitive Code: [Off-topic]; Collaborative Code: [Disagree].


Here's the Cognitive Code and the Collaborative Code mentioned above:
# Cognitive Code

    [Confusion] - Statements explicitly indicate lack of understanding or questions that seek for clarification
    [Incorrect] - Make obvious incorrect statements or make mistakes in their statements

    [Complete] - Provide complete statements associated with the task, supporting claims with explanations and evidence.
    [NA] - No cognitive statement
