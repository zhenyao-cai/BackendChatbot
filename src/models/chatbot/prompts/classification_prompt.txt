Your task:
Using the definitions and examples above, categorize the latest student message appropriately.
Follow the definitions strictly for each code. Choose the most appropriate category from both the "Cognitive Code" and the "Collaborative Code".
The output should always be in the format: Cognitive Code: [CODE]; Collaborative Code: [CODE].
For example: Cognitive Code: [Off-topic]; Collaborative Code: [Disagree].
